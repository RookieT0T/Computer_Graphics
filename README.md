# **Computer_Graphics**
These are programming projects of 22Fall COMPSCI559 offered by UW-Madison.

# Project 1
Draw a picture on a 2D Canvas on a web page.

# Project 2
Create transformations in 2D and hierarchical objects in modeling and animation.

# Project 3
Implement transformation using explicit matrix representations, using a matrix/vector library such as glMatrix or TWGL.

# Project 4
Use a parametric curve to define an intricate trajectory, and use this representation both to draw such a curve as well as move/animate an object along it.

# Project 5
Make a 3D scene, as viewed from a movable camera, and use 2D Canvas drawing operations to construct a 2D projected view of it on your screen.

# Project 6
Write vertex and fragment shaders in [shdr.bkcore.com](http://shdr.bkcore.com/).

# Project 7
Use WebGL to create a 3-dimensional scene, with written shaders, models, and associated data.

# Project 8
Use WebGL to create a 3-dimensional scene using textures to enrich the visual appearance of objects.
